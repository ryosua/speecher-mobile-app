# speecher_corona_app

This is the source code for a mobile app created by Dan and Ryan Yosua. After dissolving our mobile app company, YosuaTreeGames LLC, we have decided to open source our code, just in case anyone might find it useful. 

Speecher was a mobile app that lets people practice public speaking by creating notecards and notes to organize their speech or presentation. They can then practice the speech using the app as both a voice recorder and a timer.

##Project Setup
- Add a file called `flurry_key.lua` to the main project folder, and the API key from Flurry account by adding

		return "[flurry key]"
- In a few files we removed emails/links/codes that are no longer active. To get the project to build you may have to modify the code a bit.

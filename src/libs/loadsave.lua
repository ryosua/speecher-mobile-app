    This module that we used for data persistence is adapted from a library that can be found here:
    https://github.com/robmiracle/Simple-Table-Load-Save-Functions-for-Corona-SDK

    We have chosen not to include this code in our repository when publishing our source because although we did get permission to use the code,
    we do not want to include it in our copyright or release it under an open source license with our project (the original has no license).
